# Analysis and Predict Customer Churn
This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Analysis and Predict Customer Churn". The project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company and building a predictive model to forecast customer churn. The dataset used for this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various customer attributes such as gender, age, contract details, internet service, and payment method, among others. It also contains information on whether a customer churned or not. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing customer churn and develop a predictive model to forecast future churn.

## Files
- [**EDA.Rmd:**](EDA.Rmd) contains the source code for the Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling phase.
  1) Exploratory Data Analysis involves understanding the variables, cleaning the dataset, and visualizing and analyzing the results
  2) Predictive Modelling involves data pre-processing and modelling
- [**EDA.pdf:**](EDA.pdf) contains as a comprehensive report summarizing the findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis. It provides visualizations, statistical analysis, and key observations regarding customer churn in the telecom company.

## Objectives
By combining the insights gained from the Exploratory Data Analysis with the predictive models, we can develop strategies to effectively manage customer churn and improve customer retention in the telecom industry.
